Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Capstone project

This project aims to automate and simplify the prediction of application bottlenecks and system overloads by applying machine learning. It is a simplified approach because the solution does not need performance metrics from all application technology layers. Monitoring and analyzing basic systems metrics should be sufficient to predict application performance and resources problems.
A reasonable analogy is a simple health check at a medical doctor that possibly will indicate various diseases by just measuring human temperate, blood pressure and heart beat.
